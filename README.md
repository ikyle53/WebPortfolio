Web Design Portfolio 12/2021

This web page is my portfolio as of 12/7/2021.

  I've followed various tutorials on youtube, (in some cases) 
captured my own videos/photos, used stock photos, and learned
to use GitHub.

  About me: I wanted to start coding because of the 
 lifestyle. I wanted to stay at home or be apart of a small 
 team that I can get to know really really well and look forward
 to seeing everyday. It matches my previous lifestyle in the 
 military. I chose web design or front-end development because I
 didn't know where to start. It surprised me one day that I wanted
 to code more than I wanted to play video games. I've taken that as
 a clear sign that that's something worth working towards.
 
  My hobbies include painting miniature models for a game called
 Warhammer 40k, going to the gym daily, playing competetive video
 games, and watching esports that interest me.
